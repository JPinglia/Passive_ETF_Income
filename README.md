# Passive_ETF_Income

This project compares ETF returns and makes use of data stored in a data base rather than a csv or making use of an API call. The program reads SQL tables stored in an ETF database and pulls data as need to manipulate as a python database within Jupyter Lab.

Skills such are using SQL queryâ€™s are used to gather data as needed to perform a financial analysis. 

SQLalchemy is used as SQLite database within which the data is housed. An engine is created to interface between our notebook and the database.


# Technologies
The program is written using Jupyter notebooks, for ease of code reading and code execution via code blocks. The program lays out a stepwise reporting and program execution. The code is run in a (Dev) environment with the use of the following libraries:

Pandas
hvplot
sqlalchemy
numpy


# Usage

The use of the program requires the use of an SQLite database built using sqlalchemy.
